        //     --> Long,Short,Byte,Int,Float,Double,Boolean,Char.

        //Difference between FLOAT and DOUBLE --
        //FLOAT is of size 32 bits while DOUBLE is of size 64 bits.

        double d1 = 12E5d;     
        System.out.println(f1);
        System.out.println(d1);

        //Boolean -> Declared only with the boolean keyword and can only take the value true or false.
        boolean isn = true;
        System.out.println(isn);

        //Character -> Store a single character in single quotes like 'A'.
        char myGrade = 'A';
        System.out.println(myGrade);

        // We can use ASCII values in characters also
        char myVar1 = 73;
        System.out.println(myVar1);

        //Strings -> Store a sequence of character with double quotes.
        String greeting = "Hello";
        System.out.println(greeting);


        //Non-Primitive -> .....These data types are also called Reference Types coz they refer to objects.
        
        //Difference between PRIMITIVE and NON-Primitive is :
        //  --> Primitive are predefined in java but Non-Primitive is created by programmer and is defined.
        //  --> Primitive always has a value while Non-Primitive can be null.
        //  --> Primitive starts with a lowercase while Non-Primitive starts with a uppercase.
        //  --> Size of Primitive depends on the data types while Non-Primitive have all the same size.
